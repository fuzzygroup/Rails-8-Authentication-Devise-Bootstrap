machine learning projects can be a bit chaotic in general.  I'm thrown off by the verb "savvy" and underspecified "time bound tasks"

Oh man. I just finished the finale of Daredevil.  It’s very much art imitating life.  They shut down the grid.  Kingpin declared martial law. Elite cops squads in a cop city untouched by jurisdiction.  People put in cages, including Frank Castle.   But the three R’s theme.   The whole monologue at the end Daredevil gave.  “Resist. Rebel. Rebuild.”  I don’t care about nationals opinion,  I really want maydays protest  theme to be  “Working Class Heroes”  After everyone kept saying I was hero for my theatrical stunt in Muncie, I’m not a hero, I’m just a person who raised on doing the right fucking thing.  Mr. Roger’s Sesame Street Scooby-Doo Spider-Man Captain America  I can quote them all.   Like I’m sitting here bawling. Because what the fucking fuck how did we get here.
