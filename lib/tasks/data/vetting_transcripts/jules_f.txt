Sun, Apr 13

Hello! I'm Jules and I'm interested in joining the Indiana 50501 chat. I went to the protest on April 5th and am curious about how I can help out. Even in small ways.

1. Whoa there are so many things it's hard to unpack. I'd say what I hate most are probably the attacks on women's and LGBTQ+ rights, especially with regards to determination of their own reproductive and gender affirming care. And the attacks on their enfranchisement through HR 22 and their abilities to participate in public life through the attacks on DEI. Things are scary for queer folks everywhere, I know calls to the Trevor Project skyrocketed since November. There's a lot to unpack with the attacks on rule of law, the Constitution,  etc. But women's and LBGTQ+ rights hit close to home for me. 

2. As for what I can contribute: I'm a good writer. I used to be on my University's speech team and did quite well. So writing, researching, and presenting materials in an engaging way are strengths of mine. 

3. I like listening to podcasts, playing video games, and reading books. My academic interests were very broad (I was a Poli Sci major with minors in French, Math, and Communication). 

4. I live in congressional district 4 I believe (Lebanon IN)

I'll be starting an intensive job in May so the time I can contribute will be limited. But I want to do what I can.
