<h1>Welcome Ruby on Rails, Devise, and Bootstrap 5!</h1>

    This project leverages the power of Ruby on Rails to deliver a robust and scalable web application. With Devise integrated for user authentication, you can securely sign up, log in, and manage your account. Devise ensures a seamless, safe experience by offering features like password recovery, session management, and user registration.

    The user interface is styled using Bootstrap 5, which helps provide a clean, responsive, and modern design out-of-the-box. Whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, our app adapts beautifully to different screen sizes.
